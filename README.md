# Hi, I am Jerry!

I am a third year Combined Mathematic & Computer Science Student at UBC with interest in 
both Applied Computer Science and Theoretical Mathematics. I am deeply passionate in identifing 
real life personal problem, and solving the problem with automation. For instance, I built a [simple script](https://github.com/Friendseeker/BMODataExporter) that extracts transactions details from online banking webpage and converts it to CSV.
A minor accomplishment technical-wise but I still felt very happy about.

## What I plan to do

I am a believer that taking a 1 semester course in a certain topic does not automatically yield mastery. Therefore,
I strived to learn outside of classroom. For instance, I do algorithms problems in platforms such as Codeforce
to practice Data Structure & Algorithms. I also read difficult Math Textbooks in my spare time and [do every exercises](https://github.com/Friendseeker/Analysis-I) to ensure that I truly learned the content of the book.

In addition, as a devoted supporter of FOSS, I always aspire to contribute to different open source
softwares. I already made a PR to TypeScript to amend its type definition, and I am 
looking forward to make more constributions to the open source world, as a way for me to pay tribute to the idea of FOSS.

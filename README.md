# Hi, I am Jerry!

I am a second year Mathematic Student at UBC with interest in both Applied Computer Science and Theoretical Mathematics.
I am deeply passionate in identifing real life personal problem, and solving the problem with automation. For instance, I built
a [simple script](https://github.com/Friendseeker/BMODataExporter) that parses my banking statement and converts it to CSV.
A minor accomplishment technical-wise but I still felt very happy about.

## What I plan to do
As a devoted supporter of FOSS, I always aspire to contribute to different open source
softwares, and currently. I already made a PR to TypeScript to amend its type definition, and I am 
excited to make more PRs to the open source world, as a way for me to pay tribute to the idea of FOSS.
